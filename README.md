👋 Hi, I’m @logistic528 (she/her👩🏻)

I graduted with an Associate's degree in web design/development🤓, so I'm still remotely new to the coding world.
I am interested in becoming a front-end developer and am currently learning how to do JavaScript💻.

In my free time (currently) I like to crochet🧶, garden🌱, spend time with my cat🐈‍⬛, and work⚒️.
